    "input": "",
    "response": "Recursion is a programming technique that allows for the reuse of code. It involves breaking a problem down into smaller, more manageable steps in order to reduce the amount of time and resources required to solve the problem. The process is repeated until a solution is reached, and the solution is then taken back and used to solve a new problem. This allows for more efficient and easier-to-debug code, and can help reduce overall development time and effort."
